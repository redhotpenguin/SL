				<h2>What are keywords?</h2>
				<p>
					Keywords help target your campaign more efficiently. For example if you enter the keywords "<strong>christmas, gifts, clothes</strong>" we will be able to serve your advertisements when people are visiting sites or submitting searches with these terms. Entering keywords for your campaign can help you achieve a higher "Click through rate" for your advertisements making them much more effective. Although it is not required, we highly recommend that you enter keywords that describe your campaign.
