<h2>September 3rd, 2008 - Labor Day systems upgrade details</h2>
<p>Over the Labor Day weekend we added additional servers to the cluster powering Silver Lining.  As a result of migrating the reporting engine to a dedicated server, the links to reports were invalid for the previous day.  The links were corrected as of 12:20 pm PST September 2nd.</p>
<p>No service downtime was experienced as a result of these upgrades.  However on Sunday August 31st we experienced a 15 minute unscheduled load balancer outage at 9:43 am PST.  End users online at the time would have experienced an average period of 30 seconds where no web site connections could be made before the gateways adjusted their routing tables.  During the 15 minute outage, users could surf normally but no ads were being inserted.  To prevent further outages of this nature, we have implemented a monitoring daemon which will restart the load balancer in the event of an unplanned failure.</p>

<h2>July 13th, 2008 - Dashboard 2.0 Preview</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Silver Lining Dashboard 2.0.  This preview will allow you view and use the new application features which allow ad zone targeting by router.  Additionally, account functionality is enabled allowing multiple users to manage the same routers and ad zones.  This application is currently in test mode only, meaning that additions of ad zones and routers will not affect the current production settings.  There will be sporadic updates to this interface this week, but all data entered in by users will be saved throughout those upgrades.</p>

<h2>July 4th, 2008 - Ad zones</h2>
<p>Today is ad server Independence Day.  With the new ad zone management feature of the Silver Lining dashboard, you can configure any of your registered gateways to use ad zones on your ad servers.  You can select one of three ad size options* and add a branding image for each ad zone size.</p>
