<h2>July 13th, 2008 - Dashboard 2.0 Preview</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Silver Lining Dashboard 2.0.  This preview will allow you view and use the new application features which allow ad zone targeting by router.  Additionally, account functionality is enabled allowing multiple users to manage the same routers and ad zones.  This application is currently in test mode only, meaning that additions of ad zones and routers will not affect the current production settings.  There will be sporadic updates to this interface this week, but all data entered in by users will be saved throughout those upgrades.</p>
