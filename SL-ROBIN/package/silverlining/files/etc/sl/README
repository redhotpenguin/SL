Add your own custom blacklisted ips by adding file named custom_skips.txt

You _must_ use an ip address.  A list of current hosts in the skips.txt
file is in skips_hosts.txt.  You can use /usr/bin/host hostname.com on you
local unix box to resolve host names of remote hosts that you wish to
blacklist.
