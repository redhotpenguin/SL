=head1 NAME

Apache2::Connection::XForwardedFor - Sets the connection remote_ip to X-Forwarded-For header

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 PerlPostReadRequestHandler Apache2::Connection::XForwardedFor

Meanwhile in another mod_perl handler...

 $client_ip = $r->connection->remote_ip;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This simple module takes the X-Forwarded-For header value and sets the
remote_ip attribute of the connection object with that ip.  This module is
meant to be used with reverse proxies where the proxy sets the header to the
ip of the http client.

This module doesn't have any fancy features like similar modules, it is meant
to be short and to the point, and have some test coverage.
