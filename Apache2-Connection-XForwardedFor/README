       This simple module takes the X-Forwarded-For header value and sets the
       remote_ip attribute of the connection object with that ip.  This module
       is meant to be used with reverse proxies where the proxy sets the
       header to the ip of the http client.

       This module doesn't have any fancy features like similar modules, it is
       meant to be short and to the point, and have some test coverage.
