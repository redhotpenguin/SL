 Welcome to the <a href="http://www.silverliningnetworks.com">Silver Lining</a> Router Interface

 If you've come this far you probably need to hook your router up to the
 internet.  Click on 'network' on the upper right hand links.  Enter
 the username and password provided to you.
 
 To change the name of your access point click the 'Wireless' tab and change
 free_wireless to whatever you want.  Then click 'Save Change' and
 'Apply Changes'.
 
 To connect your router to the internet or your modem click 'WAN'.  Set
 the settings as you normally would with any other brand name router.
 If you have questions, send us a ping at <font color="red">support@silverlining.com</font>.

 Don't forget to 'Apply Changes' after you've saved them, and if you can do it
 easily unplugging the router, waiting about 30 seconds, and plugging it
 back again is usually a surefire solution to any problem.
