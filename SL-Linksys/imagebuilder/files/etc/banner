Welcome to the <a href="http://www.silverliningnetworks.com/">Silver Lining</a> Diablo Router</a> version 0.19 '<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=8-64Co6goNY">Diablo</a>'.

If you have come this far you probably need to hook your router up to the
internet.  Click on 'Network' at the top of this web page.  Enter
the username and password provided to you. (default username is 'root')

To change the SSID of your router visit <a href="https://app.silverliningnetworks.com"/>app.silverliningnetworks.com</a>.
Or you can click the 'Wireless' tab and update the SSID using the router interface.
Then click 'Save Change' and 'Apply Changes'.

To connect your router to the internet or your modem click 'WAN'.  Set
the settings as you normally would with any other brand name router.

If you have questions, send us a ping at <a href="mailto:support@silverliningnetworks.com"><font color="red">support@silverliningnetworks.com</font></a>.

Or visit the users forum at <a href="http://forums.silverliningnetworks.com/">forums.silverliningnetworks.com</a>.

Don't forget to 'Apply Changes' after you've saved them.

If the router does not respond to your changes, unplugging the router, 
waiting about 30 seconds, and plugging it back again is usually a
surefire solution to any problem.
