Welcome to the <a href="http://www.silverliningnetworks.com">Silver Lining</a> Router version 0.09.

If you've come this far you probably need to hook your router up to the
internet.  Click on 'network' on the upper right hand links.  Enter
the username and password provided to you.

To change the name of your access point click the 'Wireless' tab and change
free_wireless to whatever you want.  Then click 'Save Change' and
'Apply Changes'.

To connect your router to the internet or your modem click 'WAN'.  Set
the settings as you normally would with any other brand name router.
If you have questions, send us a ping at <a href="mailto:support@silverliningnetworks.com"><font color="red">support@silverliningnetworks.com</font></a>.

Or visit the users forum at <a href="http://forums.silverliningnetworks.com">forums.silverliningnetworks.com</a>.

Don't forget to 'Apply Changes' after you've saved them.

If the router does not respond to your changes, unplugging the router, 
waiting about 30 seconds, and plugging it back again is usually a
surefire solution to any problem.
